# V0 Projects Library

This folder holds the clean start of the project display surface. The site renders every known project from the root workspace (embedded systems, automation tooling, AI, and marketing builds) in a searchable, filterable grid.

## Getting started

1. Open `V0/index.html` in a browser (or serve it via a static host).
2. The project data lives in `projects.js`; edit that array to add new entries or update tags.
3. The layout is handled by `style.css`, and `main.js` handles search/filtering and rendering.

## Future steps

- Swap `projects.js` for JSON or CMS-backed data if you want live updates.
- Replace the placeholder cards with real thumbnails or links to each repo.
