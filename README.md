# Portfolio

This repository now maintains two portfolio surfaces:

- The original, styled landing page at the repo root (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- The clean, data-driven project catalog under `V0/`—a searchable grid that lists every known project.

## V0 Project Library

- **V0/index.html**: Minimal hero and searchable grid focused solely on the project catalog.
- **V0/style.css**: Dark, modern card layout supporting responsive grids and filters.
- **V0/projects.js**: Canonical list of projects (name, description, stack, tags) powering the grid.
- **V0/main.js**: Module that renders cards and wires the search + status filters.
- **V0/README.md**: Notes on running and extending the V0 site.

## Legacy Site (root)

- **index.html**: Original hero + project-cards layout (still available for reference).
- **style.css** / **script.js**: Styling and JS for that earlier version.
- **images/**: Placeholder assets referenced by the legacy grid.
