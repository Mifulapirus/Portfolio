# event_counter

A tiny device to log discrete events in your day-to-day life — think: finished a glass of water, bathroom visits, medication taken — with a single button. The device logs events locally and can export or sync them to a spreadsheet or server for analysis.

## Overview

`event_counter` is designed to be simple: a button, microcontroller firmware, and optional connectivity to push logs to a server or save them for later retrieval. The project includes firmware sources (PlatformIO), configuration files, and example web assets for viewing logs.
