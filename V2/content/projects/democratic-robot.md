# Democratic-Robot

Fighting robots are usually remote controlled... this one is Democratic!

## Overview
Welcome to the world of the **Weaponized Plastic League**, where robots battle for glory in New Hampshire! But this isn't your average fighting robot—this is **Democratic-Robot**, the first of its kind to embrace the chaos of democracy. 

Instead of a single driver calling the shots, this robot takes commands from the internet masses. Every two seconds, the collective will of the people determines its next move. Attack? Defend? Spin in circles? It's all up to the voters. Sure, democracy isn't perfect, but that's part of the charm. 

And don't worry about its safety—this robot is as resilient as they come, thanks to its impenetrable shield of... cardboard. Yes, cardboard. Because nothing says "unstoppable" like a thick layer of corrugated democracy.

## Technologies Used

- ESP32-C3 microcontroller
- PlatformIO for development
